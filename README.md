Swim Meet Data Analysis and App
Use a large database of swim meet results from Ridley High School and use machine learning to build a predictive algorithm for future meets.  Apply that algorithm to a shiny app along with additional features, such as simulating meets based on cross validated errors, webscraping opponent times for scouting purposes, and building and comparing lineups.
